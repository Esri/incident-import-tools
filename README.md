incident-import-tools
=====================

Toolbox and scripts for importing spreadsheets to a gdb and optionally publishing out to ArcGIS Online (feature service) or ArcGIS for Server (dynamic map service).   Geometry can be assigned to features using provided coordinate values in a known spatial reference system, or by geocoding an address associated with each incident.   These scripts can be scheduled using Windows Task Scheduler to automatically update the feature class and service.
